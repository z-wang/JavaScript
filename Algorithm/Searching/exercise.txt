1. The sequential search algorithm always finds the first occurrence of an element in a data set. Rewrite the algorithm so that the last occurrence of an element is returned.
2. Compare the time it takes to perform a sequential search with the total time it takes to both sort a data set using insertion sort and perform a binary search on the data set. What are your results?
3. Create a function that finds the second-smallest element in a data set. Can you generalize the function definition for the third-smallest, fourth-smallest, and so on? Test your functions with a data set of at least 1,000 elements. Test on both numbers and text.
