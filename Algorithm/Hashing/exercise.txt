1. Use linear probing to create a simple dictionary to store the definitions of words. Your program should have two parts. The first part reads a text file that contains a list of words and definitions and stores them in a hash table. The second part of the program allows a user to enter a word and see the definition of that word.
2. Repeat exercise 1 using separate chaining.
3. Write a program using hashing that reads a text file and compiles a list of the words in the file with the number of times each word appears in the file.
