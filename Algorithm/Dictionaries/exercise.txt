1. Write a program that takes a set of names and phone numbers from a text file and stores them in a Dictionary object. Include in your program the ability to display one phone number, display all phone numbers, add new phone numbers, remove phone numbers, and clear out the list of numbers.
2. Using the Dictionary class, write a program that stores the number of occurrences of words in a text. Your program should display each word in a text just once as well as the number of times the word occurs in the text. For example, given the text “the brown fox jumped over the blue fox,” the output will be:
the: 2
       brown: 1
       fox: 2
       jumped: 1
       over: 1
       blue: 1
3. Rewrite exercise 2 so that it displays the words in sorted order.
