greedy algorithms
==================
A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that looks for “good solutions” as it works toward the complete solution. These good solutions, called local optima, will hopefully lead to the correct final solution, called the global optimum. The term “greedy” comes from the fact that these algorithms take whatever solution looks best at the time. Often, greedy algorithms are used when it is almost impossible to find a complete solution, owing to time and/or space considerations, and yet a suboptimal solution is acceptable.
